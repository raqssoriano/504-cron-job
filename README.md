# 504: Cron Job

- This repository contains files and folders with code or languages, such as YAML files, contributed by Professor Hants, necessary to complete the ‘Creating a Cron Job’ section in my HHA504 assignment, which can be found in the **[HHA504_assignment_functions repository](https://github.com/raqssoriano/HHA504_assignment_functions.git)**

  - "Cron jobs are meant for performing regularly scheduled actions such as backups, report generation, and so on. Each of those tasks should be configured to recur indefinitely (for example: once a day/week/month); you can define the point in time within that interval when the job should start." (Bhardwaj, n.d.)
